Seeing that his son could achieve great things, Howard tried to inspire him with constant talks about his own role in the creation of Captain America.Stark proved to be a brilliant and unique child prodigy, he attended MIT for two years starting at age 14.</p>

                <p class="con">On December 16, 1991, when Stark was 21, his parents went away to the Bahamas, but planned to stop at the Pentagon to deliver supersoldier serum he had redeveloped. On their way there, both were killed in a car accidentâ€”later revealed to be an assassination carried out by the Winter Soldier who was mind controlled by Hydra to steal the serum. As a result, Stark inherited his father's company, becoming CEO of Stark Industries. Over the years, he became well known as a weapons designer and inventor, and lived a playboy lifestyle.</p>
