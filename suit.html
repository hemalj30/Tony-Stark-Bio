                <p class="con">In the late 2000s, Stark travels to war-torn Afghanistan with his friend and military liaison Lieutenant Colonel Rhodes to demonstrate Stark's new "Jericho" missile. After the demonstration, the convoy is ambushed and Stark is critically wounded and imprisoned by a terrorist group, the Ten Rings. Fellow captive Ho Yinsen, a doctor, implants an electromagnet into Stark's chest to keep shrapnel shards from reaching his heart and killing him.</p>

                <div class="text">
                <p class="con">Stark and Yinsen secretly build a small, powerful electric generator called an arc reactor to power Stark's electromagnet and a suit of powered armor. When the Ten Rings attack the workshop. Yinsen sacrifices himself to divert them while the suit is completed. The armored Stark battles his way out of the cave to find the dying Yinsen, then burns the Ten Rings' weapons in anger and flies away, crashing in the desert. Rescued by Rhodes, Stark returns home to announce that his company will no longer manufacture weapons.</p>

                <p class="con">In his home workshop, Stark builds a sleeker, more powerful version of his improvised armor suit as well as a more powerful arc reactor.</p>

                <p class="con">The defining abilities of Stark's armor are the jets situated in the boots and the repulsors situated in the gauntlets. The repulsors originated as a hand attachment, but have since become the armor's most important standard armament.</p>

                <p class="con">Another defining trait is the chest-mounted "uni-beam", also known as the variobeam, pentabeam, tri-beam, and chest RT, or chest repulsor transmitter. Originally a spotlight and "proton beam", it has grown to accommodate a number of other weapons, primarily light and force-based.</p>
